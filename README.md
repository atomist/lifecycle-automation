## Development

You will need to install [node][] to build and test this project.

### Build and Test

Command | Reason
------- | ------
`npm install` | to install all the required packages
`npm run start` | to start the Atomist automation client
`npm run lint` | to run tslint against the TypeScript
`npm run compile` | to compile all TypeScript into JavaScript
`npm test` | to run tests and ensure everything is working
`npm run autotest` | run tests continuously (you may also need to run `tsc -w`)
`npm run clean` | remove stray compiled JavaScript files and build directory

### Release

To create a new release of the project, simply push a tag of the form
`M.N.P` where `M`, `N`, and `P` are integers that form the next
appropriate [semantic version][semver] for release.  The version in
the package.json is replaced by the build and is totally ignored!  For
example:

[semver]: http://semver.org

```
$ git tag -a 1.2.3
$ git push --tags
```

The Travis CI build (see badge at the top of this page) will publish
the NPM module and automatically create a GitHub release using the tag
name for the release and the comment provided on the annotated tag as
the contents of the release notes.
